					The experience with Zoomcar has been excellent.  Your process is well thought out and the service definitely fills a void. Maybe you could start a school which teaches "real customer service"!

					I have loved your concept since the time I saw it online. Now, after using your services, this concept is wonderful and a delight to all customers. A service in other major cities would go a long way in establishing your brand as well as loyalty of customers.

					I belong to Mumbai and am currently based out of Pune. I have used many such services like Carzonrent, Girikand, Autodrive while being here but none have matched the convenience, affordability as well as efficiency of your service.

	%h2 Reva Trivia
	%p
		100 km range when vehicle is fully charged. More than enough to cruise around Bangalore with the zippiest automatic transmission out there! The sensational turning radius is merely icing on the cake.
	%p
		Even if you have a led foot and are not the model driver, you can still expect to achieve a full range of at least 85 km on a charge.
	%p
		Take it easy, as the vehicle dashboard displays how many kms can be run with current state of charge in vehicle.
	%p
		In case you're running out of juice, our reva comes with a charging chord that can be plugged in to a regular 15 Amp socket. There are also over 110 official Reva charging points across the city,

		to see Reva charging points.
	%p
		Off the grid, no worries, even if you can't reach an official Reva charging point, all you need is a 15 amp socket to charge the car completely (0-100% in 5 hours).
	%p
		Don't fret about how to plug in, it's super handy as the vehicle has a charging chord that can be found in the trunk.

	%h2 Reva Cares for Environment
	%p Reva's running cost is 10% that of a standard petrol vehicle.
	%p Only vehicle in India that can run on Solar Energy.
	%p A year in solar powered electric car is equivalent to planting over 60 trees.
	%p CO2 Saved per year per - 3.2 tonnes (assuming one drives 15,000 Kms a year).
	%p Just last year 3 million new ACs were sold in India, each of which consume enough energy per day as much as 2.4 E2Os would consume- without crashing the grid!

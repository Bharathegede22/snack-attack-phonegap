		* If you refuel the vehicle during your reservation, you will be reimbursed the full amount you pay (Fuel Receipt required).

		** Permit costs to enter Andhra Pradesh will be reimbursed by Zoomcar.

		Please book more time than you think you will need for your journey. Zoomcar is fully committed to reliably providing vehicles when our members have them reserved, so please do return your vehicle on-time. If you return a vehicle late and it causes an inconvenience to another member, you will be charged a penalty to compensate them.

	%p
		But we don't want you to pay more than you should for time you aren't Zooming! If you return a vehicle 1 hour or more before your reservation ends, you will get a driving credit for ½ of the unused time. If you have a vehicle only with a daily tariff component, you are eligible for a credit equivalent to ½ of the daily tariff in the event you return the car a day or more early (e.g. a 3 day rental that is returned 1 full day early will result in a driving credit equal to ½ of the standard daily tariff for that respective vehicle).

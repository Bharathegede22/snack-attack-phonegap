			- if @city.id == 2
				.f-b.zoom.size-16.m-b5 #{count+=1}) Why do I have to pay a deposit?
				%p
					We've seen that many of our customers like to Zoom off to extra far away destinations. In these instances, they typically have some additional charges at the end of their booking given the distance traveled. Additionally, it's not always so easy out there as a self-drive pilot and some damage will happen. This deposit will allow Zoom to seamlessly complete these transactions without the hassle of a human intervention as part of a formal online payment process. Our helpful support team can reconcile your payment remotely and clear your final bill in a matter of seconds. This will ensure that you are Zooming off not only at the start of your booking but also the end.
				%p
					Don't worry, we will only charge you the exact amount of the extra charges or damages, you do not forfeit your entire deposit for charges that are less than Rs 5000.
				%p
					Please do keep in mind that though we refund the remaining amount immediately it will take 4-5 business days before it reflects in your account.

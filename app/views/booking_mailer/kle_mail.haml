Hi #{@booking.user_name},

We are releasing some cool new technology that allows you to enter and exit your Zoomcar keyless-ly at the start and end of your booking. You can unlock the car with the Zoomcar app or even just an SMS, grab the keys inside, and then Zoom off.

We have been working tirelessly on this technology so that our users can begin and end their bookings on their own terms, going through the pick-up and drop off processes as quickly as they want. From now on you are completely in control of your booking. This also allows us to grow extremely fast since the same friendly fleet executives can now help out at many more sites – that means we can open a location within a kilometer of you even sooner!

However, to get valuable feedback, we want to do a small release within our self-drive community and your booking is from one of the locations we have chosen for this. So, you will be one of the first few users to go through the keyless process. The process is super simple and the description is below, plus we will be communicating with you wherever you need help. If you don’t have feedback to share, don’t worry - just enjoy the new experience!

You can now enter a Zoomcar at the start of your booking or exit it at the end keyless-ly:
%ul
	%li 
		%b Your Car: 
		We will SMS your car's number plate 20 minute before your booking starts.
	%li 
		%b Unlock: 
		At the start of your booking, to unlock the car use the Zoomcar app or SMS "UNLOCK" to #{CommonHelper::KLE_UNLOCK_NUMBER} from the phone number linked to your Zoomcar account. Watch the magic unfold!
	%li 
		%b Grab Car Key: 
		The key will be inside the glove-box. You can unlock and lock the car keyless-ly only once during your booking, so keep the key on you.
	%li 
		%b Checklist: 
		Go through the checklist on the in-car tablet's Zoomcar app. We ensure the car has everything for a smooth journey. Please remember if the checklist is not filled we will assume you found everything in great condition.
	%li 
		%b Start Your Journey: 
		Zoom off!
	%li 
		%b Return: 
		Place the key back inside the glove-box. Complete the super-quick return checklist on the tablet.
	%li 
		%b Lock: 
		The car auto-locks 5 minutes after you submit the return checklist. You are now all set! See you again soon at the wheel of another Zoomcar.

Please make sure the number linked with your Zoomcar account is your correct number: #{@booking.user_mobile}. We will text your car’s details on this number, and also allow unlocking the car via SMS through only this number. Do also update your Zoomcar app to enjoy the latest keyless features!
